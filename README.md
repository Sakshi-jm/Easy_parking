- âš¡ Fun fact: he world's first IoT-based car parking system was installed in 2012 in San Francisco. This smart parking system used sensors embedded in the ground to detect the presence of vehicles and transmitted real-time parking information to a mobile app, helping drivers find available parking spaces more efficiently. This marked a significant step towards utilizing IoT technology to enhance urban mobility and reduce the hassle of parking in busy cities.
